        <h2>Philippians 4:13: I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</h2>
        <p>This verse teaches that God can help us overcome challenges and give us courage in difficult times.</p>
        <h2>Ecclesiastes 3:1: To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.</h2>
        <p>This verse provides comfort and patience, especially during difficult times, as it reassures us that God has a plan and timing for everything.</p>
        <h2>1 John 4:19: We love Him because He first loved us.</h2>
        <p>God's love is the foundation and reason for our love. Our ability to love others flows from the fact that God loved us first.</p>
