        <p>Many people I've met have truly become my friends and have stood as my father and mother in the church. Because of them, I've learned so much. I am very blessed to be part of the DBC family.</p>

        <p>Let me share with you how I was saved. Through the guidance of our Pastor Roreinz Faniega, he taught us that we must accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior to receive salvation. We all know that we are sinners, and now is the time for us to be saved, kapatid.</p>
